I love to use vintage maps of places special to me in my interior crafts. A lovely way to use vintage maps is by making upcycled lighting with them.

In the previous tutorial we discussed the possibility of each object having a unique material of its own that reacts differently to light. A lightning strike or lightning bolt is an electric discharge between the atmosphere and an object. They mostly originate in a cumulonimbus cloud and terminate on the ground, called cloud to ground (CG) lightning.

I dunno if this is a question for this subreddit or Unity specific ones amp#x200B; Okay so, I have no idea if this is possible because I just started getting into shaders (mainly for a 2D game) and I seem to be relying on a decent amount of lights and standard unity PBR shader (using normal and specular maps). But since all the lighting is static and so are my own shaders, I would love to cache the data or save the data as a png image(?). Now I dunno if its even in the realms of possibilit.

So most of the big VTTs have dynamic lightning now, but building these maps out is a pain in the ass. Roll20 does have some support in mods and purchases for pre-lit pieces, but has a pretty terrible map builder. Is there a VTT out there that has a good map editor with pieces I can place (say a wall on the actual map layer) that will automatically fill in the lighting layer for that piece. Alibaba.com offers 3,176 lighting maps products. About 1% of these are map, 1% are tapestry, and 1% are phosphate fertilizer. A wide variety of lighting maps options are available to you, such as wood, 100% cotton, and metal. 
I am working through the Roguelike tutorial (though converting it to Game Maker) and I am just implementing Field of View. I have an array holding my tile information in a bitmask (isBlockingMovement, isBlockingSight etc. ) and I am not sure whether to include the light information (isSeen, isVisible) or to move them to another array. amp#x200B; Any advice? Will it even make a difference. Show me the weather in. city, zip, or place. Recently searched. No items to display.

Mostly getting plants and stuff washed out with these insane orange-yellow colours, but almost any nearby physics affected object (zombie ragdoll, some thrown items) take on the psychedelic lightmap as well. It's not a massive issue but it's killing immersion to blast a fool and have them go technicolour. I've messed with settings to see if maybe my computer wasn't pushing the power it needed or something but it's consistent. The game plays super well and is a blast with interesting if predict. The latest lightning strikes updated and displayed in real-time on Google. Okay so I have this map of a building with electrical details (relays, fixture placements, etc.) and I'm trying to color code it. I've tried using ms paint, but it keeps crashing my damn computer. Are there any good editing softwares out there similar to paint that aren't total computer cancer. 
NIFC Lightning Viewer  NIFC Lightning Viewer. Before last year's con, I found a map that showed where the turned-on overhead lights were in relation to the byoc table setup. This year my Google-fu is failing me.Does anyone know where My question is pretty self-explanatory. In the background of my scenes, I'd like a very high resolution panorama. However, these lead to complex reflections and lighting that takes a very long time to render. I wonder if it's possible to get thr best of both, with a high resolution background which doesn't actually provide lighting - instead, the actual lighting is provided by a different (lower resolution). The Location-specific Lightning Alert Webpage can help you monitor the lightning activities in your location or other location of interest. Users can simply select the location of interest and choose a circular range around the location in the webpage. Something like blitzortungs website. I live in Norway. Indoor Safety Rules. When lightning strikes a building, house or other structure, it follows metal conductors such as electrical wiring, plumbing and telephone lines from the structure to the ground. 
This article will describe how to achieve Normal Mapped Lighting for 2D Sprites in Futile/Unity using a lighting normal map and a custom shader.

Find Chinese best lighting maps suppliers on DHgate.com. Purchase high quality goods directly from China lighting maps manufacturers. Does anyone know of a game that implements "fuzzy" field-of-view calculations? I'm working on a game that will have some stealth elements, and I'd like for squares that are partially obscured to be marked as such on the FoV map; perhaps a float in 0,1 for each square based on what portion of the square is obscured. This could be combined with a lighting map to determine the chance for detecting something there. All the FoV algorithms I've seen return "visible" or "not visible" with no in-be. See the latest lighting strikes, snow and severe weather maps on AccuWeather.com. Guys I really tried hard to like this game. I Played this game from launch and I've come to conclusion this game is just not for me. The bugs, weapon balance, team balance, lack of content, player visibility, lighting, maps, attrition system. The two main things in this game that are killing it for me is player visibility and map design. OMG the maps in this game are soooo boring and stale. Not one map I look forward to playing on. I hate how 90% of these maps are so open and punish 
Use the interactive radar to see where lightning is striking The night is dark, and the cold wind blows upon your ill-dressed bodies. Shouldn't this place have been an exotic vacation? And yet, this southern island has never felt more like a wintery hell. The denizens that live it are no less hellish. They look at you discussing while in complete silence, like Gargoyles, waiting for your next move and topic. Among these pops out an exceedingly pale looking girl, sitting cross-legged on the floor with a Cheshire Cat smile on her face among the front. Lightning Maps. Thunderforest Lightning Maps are a new way to create and style maps. Based on vector tile technology, this system has been rolled out across the whole Thunderforest platform. Zzzzz--! With a loud zap, the Old Man‚Äôs speakers came back to life for another round, channelling his words throughout the entirety of the city complex. Through his voice, you could hear that he was rather upset and, most likely, even disappointed. ‚ÄúI cannot fathom to look at you grovelling like rats any longer. I want to see some PROGRESS!

The NASA team is also now automating nighttime imagery processing to make the data available within hours of acquisition ‚Äî potentially aiding short-term weather. Here is a recap of the current situation: Stabularius is about to fall asleep on the throne. Canemdrupes is about to follow in his father's shoes. Lycantare has been observing closely and jotting down into her mind every single word and statement spoken during the trial.

Today, private companies and open-source groups operate networks of special sensors that can detect radio waves produced by lightning. </p>
